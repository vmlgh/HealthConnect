# HealthConnect
Develop a platform for people who need medical assistance and can connect with doctors conveniently. This platform enables doctors who are willing to provide extended services apart from their usual work to support patients seamlessly. Through this platform, there is an increased awareness of several doctors who are keen to provide online consultations. Anyone accessing this platform can connect with doctors specialized in relevant fields, book both online/offline appointments and get their queries answered.

We all have encountered situations where we had to reach out to doctors in the recent times but were hesitant because of the coronavirus outbreak. Although the hospital facilities were not completely shut, they were crowded, had long waiting queues, and had high operating costs set by hospitals.
Through this platform, we are trying to minimize these issues, and ease the process of connecting doctors and patients at their convenience.

	Doctors and patients can sign up and log in to the application
